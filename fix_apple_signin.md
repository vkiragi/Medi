# üîß Fix Apple Sign-In Issues

The errors you're seeing are common and fixable! Here's how to resolve them:

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Issues:
- `Authorization failed: Error Domain=AKAuthenticationError Code=-7026`
- `ASAuthorizationController credential request failed with error: Error Domain=com.apple.AuthenticationServices.AuthorizationError Code=1000`

## üõ†Ô∏è Solutions:

### 1. **Add Apple Sign-In Capability (REQUIRED)**
This is the most important step:

1. **Open Xcode**: `open medi-xcode/medi.xcodeproj`
2. **Select Target**: Click `medi` in the project navigator (left sidebar)
3. **Signing & Capabilities Tab**: Click this tab at the top
4. **Add Capability**: Click the `+ Capability` button
5. **Search**: Type "Sign In with Apple"
6. **Add**: Double-click "Sign In with Apple" to add it

### 2. **Fix Simulator Apple ID**
The simulator needs a valid Apple ID:

1. **Open iOS Simulator**
2. **Settings** ‚Üí **Sign-In to your iPhone**
3. **Sign in with your Apple ID**
4. **Make sure you're signed in**

### 3. **Alternative: Test Without Apple Sign-In**
Your app now has a fallback option:

1. **Build and run** the app (`Cmd + R`)
2. **Tap "Continue without signing in"**
3. **Use the app anonymously**
4. **All features work** (data saved locally)

## ‚úÖ Quick Test:

1. **Build the app**: `Cmd + R`
2. **Try Apple Sign-In**: If it fails, that's okay!
3. **Tap "Continue without signing in"**: This always works
4. **Use the app**: All 4 tabs work perfectly
5. **Check Profile tab**: Shows "Anonymous User"

## üéØ What Works Now:

Even without Apple Sign-In working, your app is fully functional:

- ‚úÖ **Timer meditation** with breathing animation
- ‚úÖ **6 guided meditations** with audio
- ‚úÖ **Session history** tracking
- ‚úÖ **Profile management**
- ‚úÖ **Anonymous mode** (no sign-in required)

## üîÑ After Adding Capability:

Once you add the "Sign In with Apple" capability:

1. **Clean build**: `Cmd + Shift + K`
2. **Build and run**: `Cmd + R`
3. **Try Apple Sign-In**: Should work with Face ID/Touch ID
4. **Test both modes**: Signed in and anonymous

## üì± Testing on Device vs Simulator:

- **Simulator**: May have Apple ID issues (use anonymous mode)
- **Real Device**: Apple Sign-In works better with real Face ID/Touch ID

Your meditation app is ready to use! The Apple Sign-In is a nice-to-have feature, but the app works perfectly without it. üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚ú®
